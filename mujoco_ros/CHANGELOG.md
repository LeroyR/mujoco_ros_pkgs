# Unreleased

## Changes
1. Better setup and cleanup in init function. This enables running the application multiple times (consecutively) when used as library:
  - exitrequest is set to 0 on start.
  - if ros time is not zero, the simulation is initialized with the current ros time as start time.
  - run i.e. the pause flag is now explicitly set according to the unpause ros param.
  - The services are explicitly unregistered on shutdown and the static services list is cleared.
2. Async spinner is now manually shutdown and ros::shutdown is called on server node termination.
3. Added unit tests for `mujoco_ros` single environment library functions.
4. Added possibility to set initial joint positions and velocities for ball and free joints (i.e. joints with more than one DoF) and edited tests to reflect the changes.
5. Changed the way single and parallel env is handled. Instead of using separate functions, most library function check the running simulation type (PARALLEL or SINGLE). In case of parallel env execution, The mj_env_ (renamed to main_env_) variable now contains a pointer to the selected main environment, which will be used for rendering, if enabled.

## Fixes
1. Fixed step counter ignoring multiple steps during synchronization if desynchronized.
2. Fixed wrong declaration of publishSimTime in header.
3. Fixed bootstrap_launchargs not being passed on to the ns_bootstrapping node



# 3.0.0

## Changes
1. Changed how `MujocoEnv` is initialized/loaded/reloaded/resetted.

The `mujoco\_server` node will search for a `ns` (robot namespace) parameter, which defaults to "/", i.e. ROS root (no sub-namespace). The single `MujocoEnv` receives this namespace to initialize a ros `NodeHandle` in its assigned namespace. By passing a pointer of the handle to its plugins, the plugins can fetch the namespace from the handle or simply use the handle to register topics and services in the correct namespace.

Introduced new reset and reload function in `MujocoEnv` that trigger the respective functions of its members.
Plugin parsing and initialization moved to `MujocoEnv`.

Due to the changes in `MujocoPlugin`, plugins need to be rebuilt (hence the major version bump).

2. Added some more documentation.
3. Added `lastStageCallback` function to `MujocoPlugin` which can be used to define behavior which should be run at the end of a simulation step. Note that this function gets called by the `mujoco\_ros` simulation loop and not by the mujoco engine, hence it won't be called in between engine sub-steps.
4. Changed mjENABLED_ros/mjDISABLED_ros definitions to not rely on static context.

## Fixes
1. Removed `collision_function` typedef, which is a duplicate defenition of mjfCollision.
2. Removed `runContactFilterCbs` from `MujocoEnv`, since contact filter callbacks fully override the standard behavior. For contact filtering a similar approach to collision function registration should be used.
